education and artificial intelligence
key features are: it is versatile, easy to learn has a large community and and has more career oppotunties.

2.How do you write a comment in python and what is the important of comment?
ans: The importance of comment is to explain codes and to comment for single line you use the # and for the mutiple line comment you use the """ or '''

3.what is the difference between print() and input() functions?
ans: print is used to get the output of values or text to the screen. eg print(hello world) 
input is used to get the user data or input on the keyboard;. eg input("i am chisom")

4.provide an example of each aw do u declare of initialise variables in python? 
ans: float variable = x = 5.13
integer variable  = X = 10
string variable  = "i am Xom"
boolean = is_chisom
list = fruits = [apple, mango, orange, watermelon]
dictionary = {"name","chisom" "state","imo"}

5. what are the basic data type in python? provide examples for int, float, string  and boolean.
ans: 
number data type: integer: X = 10
float, X = 5.14
text data type: strings: "i am Xom" "i love you"
sequence data type: list: fruits = [apple, mango, orange, watermelon]
tuple: ("biro", "book",  "book", sharpener")

6.what is the difference between list and tuple in python? 
ans: list are mutable and can be modified while tuple is not mutable and can not be modified after creation.'
list uses the [] brackets while tuple uses the () brackets. 


7. what is a conditional statement in python? write a program to check if number is postive negative or zero? 
ans: python conditional statement is a specfic code used to execute the a certain conditions or set of conditions.

example: X = float(input("input number"))
if X > 0
print(f"{x} is a postive number" )
elif X < 0
print(f"{x} is a negative number")
else:
print(f"{x} is zero")

8. explain the concepts of loops in python. what the difference between for and while loop?
ans: the concepts of loops is a block of code used to exceute a code that is to be repeated many times until a particular condition is met.
difference.
for loop is implicit loop condition.  ilerate over a sequence. not manually updated
while loop is explicit loop condition. manually updated. over a condition and it true.

9.how do you write a function in python? write a simple function to caculate the square of a number
ans:  def function_name(parameters):
        function body and it must be indented
        excute code

example: def square(number)
            result number ** 2
        number = 5 
        result = square(number)
        print(f"the square of {number} is  equal {result}" )
10. what is the purpose of the len() function in python? demonstrate it by finding the length of a string. would you like me to provide solutions or additional exercises basesd 
on these questions
ans: the purpose of len() is used to check the length of string in a code 
example: 

General concepts:
1. What is python and why is it popular?
ans:  python is high-level intepretated programming language that is used for web development, education, data analysis, 
education and artificial intelligence and it is popular because it is versatile, easy to learn has a large community and and has more career oppotunties.

2.What are the basic rules for naming a variable in python? 
ans: the basic rules are indentation, error handling, comments, operators, functions, comments.

3:what is the difference between dynamically typed and statically typed language, and which type is python language? 
ans: dynamic type of language which holds different types of data while static can only hold one specific data.
python is a dynamic language.

4.How do u display a message on the screen using python? 
ans: we can display message on the screen using PRINT()

5.Data types and variables, what are the basic data type in python, provide example of int, float, string and boolean
ans:
number data type: integer: X = 10
float, X = 5.14
text data type: strings: "i am Xom" "i love you"
sequence data type: list: fruits = [apple, mango, orange, watermelon]
tuple: ("biro", "book",  "book", sharpener")
mapping data type: dictionary: {"name","chisom" "state","imo" "country" "nigeria"}
boolean types: is_chisom

6. what is the difference between mutable and immutable data?
ans: the difference is mutable can be modified (lists, dioctionary, sets)
while immutable cannot be modified (integer, floats, strings, tuples)

7. how do you peform type conversion in python? convert a string to an integer with an example. 
ans: floats to integer, integers to float, strings to integer, integer to strings, float to strings, boolean to integer, 
integer to boolean.
example: string to integer: x=5 y=int(x) print(y) output= 5

Control flow

8.what are the conditional statements in python. write a program to know if the number is even or odd.
ans: python conditional statement is a specfic code used to execute the a certain conditions or set of conditions.

the code for odd number:
range (1,50)
for Q in range(1,50):
     if ((Q%2)==1):
          print(Q)
for even number:
range (1,50)
for Q in range(1,50):
     if ((Q%2)==0):
          print(Q)

          to detect if it even or odd:
def check_even_odd(num):
 if num % 2 -- 0:
    return f"{num} is even"
 else: return f" {num} is odd"
num = int(input("type a number"))
print(check_even_odd(num))

9.  what is the differnce between if, elif, else statement nd write a program to find the largest of three numbers using if-else statements.
if statement : use to check a condition or excutes a block of code 
elif statement: used to check mutiple conditions or executes diffferent block of code based on the condition that is true
else statement: used to specify a block of code to execute when if condition is false

examples:



Loops:
10. what are the loops in python? difference between a for loop and while loop?
loops in python.
ans: the concepts of loops is a block of code used to exceute a code that is to be repeated many times until a particular condition is met.
difference.
for loop is implicit loop condition.  ilerate over a sequence. not manually updated
while loop is explicit loop condition. manually updated. over a condition and it true.

11. write a program to print the first 10 number of multiplication tables
ans: num = int(input(enter the table number))
print (multiplication table of {num})
for i in range (1,11)
print (f"{num} X {i} = {num * i}")

12. what is the purpose of break and continue in loops and write a program to calucate sum of all numbers from 1-10 using a loop
ans: break statement is used to termainate the loop entirely while continue statement is used to skip the current illeration and move to the next

examples:
n= 100
sum n*(n+1) //2
print ("the sum of numbers from 1 to", n , "1s:", sum )

functions


13.what is a function in python and why is it used
ans: function is a block of code that can be executed multiple times from different parts of your program
it is used for modularity, code reuseabilty, errror handling, abstrasction.

14.write a function to calucate the area of rectangle?
ans:
def caculate_area_rectangle(length,width):
return length * width
length = float(input("enter your length"))
width = float(input("enter your width"))

print(f"Area{caculate_area_rectangle(length,width):}")


15. what are default arguments in python functions provide examples.
ans: default arguments are arguments assigned to a function arguments when no value is provided by the caller
example: def greet (name, message = "hello")
print(f"{message} {name}!")

Collections

16. what is the difference between list, tuple , and set in python
ans: list are mutable and can be modified while tuple is not mutable and can not be modified and set is an unordered collection, no duplicate allowed, and mutable after creation.'
list uses the [] brackets while tuple uses the () brackets. 

17. how do you add and remove elements of a list use the append, insert and remove.
ans.
append = my_list = [1,2, 3]
my_list.append(4)
print(my_list) output(1,2,3,4)

insert = my_list = [1,2, 3]
my_list.insert(1,4)
print(my_list) output(1,4,2,3)

remove = my_list = [1,2, 3,4,5]
my_list.remove(2)
print(my_list) output(1,3,4,5)


18.what is a dictionary in python? 
dictionary is a data structure that stores a collection of key-value pairs. 


19. create a dictionary to store information about a student and retrieve values by keys?
ans. dictionary: {"name","chisom" "state","imo" "country" "nigeria","class" "ss3"}
